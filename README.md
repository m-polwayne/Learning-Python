# Python-Week--1
Python is case sensitive so it is important that you use the correct case, otherwise your code will not work.

Text values need to appear in speech marks (") but numbers do not. When naming variables (i.e. values that you want to store data in) you cannot use any dedicated words such as print, input, etc. otherwise your code will not work.

If statements allow your program to make a decision and change the route that is taken through the program

Indenting is very important in Python as it shows the lines that are dependent on others, as shown in the example on the previous page. In order to indent text you can use your [Tab] key or you can press your [space key] five times. The [backspace] key will remove indents.  

String is the technical name for text. To define a block of code as a string, you need to include it in either double quotes (") or single quotes ('). It doesn’t matter which you use so long as you are consistent. 

len(word) Finds the length of variable called word. 

print(word.capitalize()) Displays the variable so only the first word has a capital letter at the beginning and everything else is in lower case. 

word.upper() Changes the string into upper case. 
word.lower() Changes the string into lower case
word.title() Changes a phrase so that every word has a capital letter at the beginning with the rest of the letters in the word in lower case (i.e.Title Case)
text = “ This is some text. ” print(text.strip(“ ”)) Removes extra characters (in this case spaces) from the start and end of a string.
