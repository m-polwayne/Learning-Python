Ladies and gentlemen,

Today, I want to introduce you to a fundamental concept in Python programming: functions.

Functions in Python allow us to contain blocks of code for reuse. They make our code more organized, readable, and maintainable.

Here's a simple example:

```python
def greet(name):
    return f"Hello, {name}!"

print(greet("Alice"))
```

In this example, the `greet` function takes a name as input and returns a greeting message.

Functions in Python can do much more, like modifying variables, performing calculations, and interacting with users. They can be nested, passed as arguments like lambdas, or returned as values.

In summary, functions are the building blocks of Python programs, enabling segmentation, reusability, and clearer code. So, next time you write code, think about how functions can help. Thank you.
