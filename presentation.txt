Ladies and gentlemen,

Today, I will be presenting to you a fundamental concept in Python programming: functions.
starting with the anatomy of a function, Functions are composed of a name and parameters, 
which are denoted by the def statement.
first its the def statement followed by the name of the function followed by the parameters 
or arguments in brackets and the functions operations indented under.
Functions in Python allow us to contain blocks of code for reuse in cases where an operation
needs to be repeated, without having to repeat coding the operation. 
They make our code more organized, readable, and maintainable.

Here's a simple example of a function which we used to move the python in our python project

In this example, the move function moves the head of the python in the x or y direction by increasing or decreasing the 
x or y coordinate of the head object.

Functions in Python can do much more, like modifying variables, performing calculations, and interacting with users. 
They can be nested, passed as arguments like lambdas,they can return values or be returned as values.

In summary, functions are the building blocks of Python programs, enabling segmentation, reusability,
and clearer code. Thank you.

 
``def move():
    if head.direction == "up":
        y = head.ycor()
        head.sety(y + increment)

    if head.direction == "down":
        y = head.ycor()
        head.sety(y - increment)

    if head.direction == "left":
        x = head.xcor()
        head.setx(x - increment)

    if head.direction == "right":
        x = head.xcor()
        head.setx(x + increment)
```
