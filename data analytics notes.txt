data analytics
    Analytics programs allow businesses to access the untapped value locked within their data.
    We collect data from many sources to derive insights
    data anlytics is growing because of growing data, cheaper storage and growing computing power
    data can be structural data or unstructured data, 
    stractural data is rectangular and can be represented in a table, eg. saving a persons details, name , surname, id 
    unstructured data cannot be represented as a table, such as images, audio and video and cannot be added to a spread sheet 

data types.

    A data element is an attribute about a person, place, or thing containing data within a range of values. 
    Data elements also describe characteristics of activities, including orders, transactions, and events. 
    A data type limits the values a data element can have
    Individual data types support structured, unstructured, and semi-structured data
    Tabular data is data organized into a table, made up of columns and rows
    Structured data is tabular in nature and organized into rows and columns.
    The character data type limits data entry to only valid characters. 
    Characters can include the alphabet that you might see on your keyboard, as well as numbers.
    Alphanumeric is the most widely used data type for storing character-based data.
    Strong typing is when technology rigidly enforces data types
    Weak typing loosely enforces data types

qualitative & quantitative data

    Quantitative data consists of numeric values. Data elements whose values come from counting or measuring are quantitative
    Qualitative data consists of frequent text values. Data elements whose values describe characteristics, traits, and attitudes are all qualitative

discrete and continuous

    discrete data represents measurements that can't be subdivided.
    when you measure things like height and weight, you are collecting continuous data

Relational and nonrelation data

    Relational databases excel at storing and processing structured data
    The need to interact with unstructured data is one of the reasons behind the rise of nonrelational databases
    Cardinality refers to the relationship between two entities, showing how many instances of one entity relate to instances in another entity
    A unary relationship is when an entity has a connection with itself. For example, a unary relationship where a single manager has multiple employees.
